# Heading

`Heading` is used to display headings (h1-h6).

<Canvas>
  <div>
    <h1 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--1">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h1>
    <h2 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--2">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h2>
    <h3 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--3">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h3>
    <h4 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--4">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h4>
    <h5 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--5">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h5>
    <h6 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--6">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h6>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## No margin

Use the class `.waykeecom-no-margin` to remove margins for the headings.

<Canvas>
  <div>
    <h1 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--1 waykeecom-no-margin">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h1>
    <h2 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--2 waykeecom-no-margin">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h2>
    <h3 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--3 waykeecom-no-margin">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h3>
    <h4 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--4 waykeecom-no-margin">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h4>
    <h5 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--5 waykeecom-no-margin">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h5>
    <h6 className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--6 waykeecom-no-margin">Almost before we knew it, we had left the ground</h6>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Non-heading styling

It is also possible to use the heading classes to style non-heading elements to use the styling only.

<Canvas>
  <div>
    <div className="waykeecom-heading waykeecom-heading--1">This is a div with h1 styling</div>
  </div>
</Canvas>
